# Introduction
This is a code repo for a multiplayer strategy game about trade and conflict in a galactic empire.

The game uses Microsoft SQL Server database with schema managed by Liquibase and game state incremented by a Python tick script.

There is a Python Flask API for players to make changes and a React frontend to serve as a web client for this API.
