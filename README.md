# Introduction
This is a code repo for a multiplayer strategy game about trade and conflict in a galactic empire.

Below is a description of the technical components to enable the game. For more information about the gameplay, please visit the website.

The game uses Microsoft SQL Server database with schema managed by Liquibase and game state incremented by a Python tick script.

There is a Python Flask API for players to make changes and a React frontend to serve as a web client for this API.
